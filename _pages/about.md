Dr. Catherine (Casey) Ivanovich is a climate scientist interested in the physical and social drivers of climate variability and change. She is passionate about investigating the dynamics and impacts of climate extremes, and communicating scientific concepts in a way that is engaging and accessible to the public.

Casey is currently a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellow at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), advised by Dr. Benjamin Cook. Her work will investigate how land surface type constrains the influence of surface moisture on dry versus humid heat extremes around the world.

Casey completed her PhD in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University in July 2024, working with advisors Dr. Radley Horton and Dr. Adam Sobel. Her dissertation research focused on improving our understanding of when and why extreme humid heat occurs in order to prepare for its human health and socioeconomic impacts.

Before beginning her studies at Columbia, Casey served as a High Meadows Fellow at the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, DC. In 2017, she graduated from Princeton University with a B.A. degree in Geosciences.
