Today I started my new position as a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) fellow at NASA GISS! Very excited to extend my dissertation research to think more explicitly about how land surface type constrains the relationship between surface moisture and different types of heat extremes.

## I passed my defense!

It's official! I successfully defended my dissertation titled, "Characterizing the Local, Regional, and Global Drivers of Extreme Humid Heat" in front of an audience of colleagues, friends, and family. What an amazing way to cap my experience at Lamont!
