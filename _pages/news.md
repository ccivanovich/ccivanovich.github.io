I'm honored to be this year's recipient of the Peter B. Wagner Memorial Award for Women in Atmospheric Sciences. I attended an award ceremony at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, NV celebrating my winning paper, [Stickiness: A New Variable to Characterize the Temperature and Humidity Contributions toward Humid Heat](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/81/5/JAS-D-23-0072.1.xml) and presented the work during a lunch seminar.

Today I started my new position as a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) fellow at NASA GISS! Very excited to extend my dissertation research to think more explicitly about how land surface type constrains the relationship between surface moisture and different types of heat extremes.

It's official! I successfully defended my dissertation titled, "Characterizing the Local, Regional, and Global Drivers of Extreme Humid Heat" in front of an audience of colleagues, friends, and family. What an amazing way to cap my experience at Lamont!

This week I traveled to Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo to meet with collaborators and stakeholderson relating to current research project investigating the drivers of the November 2023 heatwave in Rio de Janeiro. I gave research presentations at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro and the Universidade de São Paulo. I also met with city officials to discuss ongoing green infrastructure projects to reduce urban heat islands and the development of extreme heat warning systems.
