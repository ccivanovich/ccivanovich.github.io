Abstract: The South Asian summer monsoon strongly modulates regional temperature and humidity. While extreme dry heat peaks in the pre-monsoon season, recent literature suggests that extreme humid heat can continue to build throughout the monsoon season. Here we explore the influence of monsoon onset and subseasonal precipitation variability on the occurrence of extreme wet bulb temperatures (Tw) across South Asia. We find that extreme Tw events often occur on rainy days during the monsoon season. However, the influence of precipitation on Tw varies with the background climatology of surface specific humidity. In climatologically drier areas, positive Tw anomalies tend to occur when precipitation increases due to either early onset or wet spells during the monsoon. In contrast, in climatologically humid areas, positive Tw anomalies occur during periods of suppressed precipitation, including both delayed onset and dry spells during the monsoon.
