Abstract: Extreme humid heat events have seen rapid increases globally in recent decades, but regional changes and higher-order temporal characteristics, such as interannual and intra-annual clustering, have not been widely explored. Using ERA5 reanalysis data from 1979 to 2019, we find increasing trends of varying magnitudes in extreme wet-bulb temperatures at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) regional scale. In many locations, interannual variations in extremes show a strong relationship with the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation. The temporal proximity of precipitation events to humid heat days in arid regions suggests that local moisture effects may lead to clustering. Knowledge of these spatial and temporal patterns aids in understanding how potential heat stress is increasing, as well as facilitates the development of regionally specific adaptation and mitigation strategies for combating the associated societal impacts.
